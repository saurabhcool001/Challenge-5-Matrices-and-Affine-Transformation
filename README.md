# Challenge-5-Matrices-and-Affine-Transformation

With programming language/framework/engine(C++, C#, Python) you choose, “hard-code”(ie, not use existing libraries) a function that does matrices/vector operations.
Create a triangle (with 3 vertices and 3 lines). Use the function created to apply affine transformations to the triangle(vertices).
Example: https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/matrixv.html
Create seven sliders. Three to control the rotation of the triangle around the three axes. One to control the scaling of the triangle. Another three to control the translation of the triangle.
Think: when you have multiple transformations(rotation, scaling, translation..), does the sequence matter?
Please submit commented codes and a short video of the visual result.
